1. Project Overview
Community Medicine & Supplies Finder is a community-driven website that enables users to quickly locate nearby pharmacies with their needed medicines and medical supplies in real time. The platform aggregates crowd-sourced availability reports from pharmacies and volunteers, displaying them on an interactive map with timestamps and confidence indicators to reflect the data. Users can search for specific items, view alternative medicines, and maintain spatial awareness of all nearby pharmacies, reducing uncertainty, travel time, and stress during both everyday needs and periods of supply shortages.
